    <strong>Telescope</strong> is a web application designed to provide an intuitive interface for exploring log data. It is built to work with any type of logs, as long as they are stored in <strong><a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse" target="_blank">ClickHouse</a></strong>. Users can easily configure connections to their ClickHouse databases and run queries to filter, search, and analyze logs efficiently. While ClickHouse is the primary supported storage backend, future versions of Telescope may introduce support for additional data sources.
