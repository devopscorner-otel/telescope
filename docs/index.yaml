    <strong>Telescope</strong> is a web application that provides an intuitive interface for exploring log data.
    It supports multiple data sources, including <strong><a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse" target="_blank">ClickHouse</a></strong> and 
    <strong><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a></strong>. Users can configure connections, filter and search logs, and 
    build visualizations through a unified and user-friendly interface. Telescope uses FlyQL as a query abstraction layer, 
    offering a consistent and secure querying experience across different source types. While ClickHouse remains the primary backend 
    for structured log storage, support for additional sources is continuously evolving.
